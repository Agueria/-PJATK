Write a program reading (using a Scanner) three values of type boolean and storing them in three variables (e.g., a, b and c). 

Then define five additional logical variables and set their values according to the following interpretation (abbreviation iff stands for if, and only if ): 

• allThree: true iff all three values are true; 
• exactlyOne: true iff exactly one of them is true; 
• exactlyTwo: true iff exactly two are true; 
• atLeastOne: true iff at least one of them is true;
• atLeastTwo: true iff at least two of them are true; 

NOTE: entering a logical value from the keyboard, type the word true or false. The following program

should, for some combinations of input values, print 

a, b, c = false, true, false 
allThree: false 
exactlyOne: true 
exactlyTwo: false 
atLeastOne: true 
atLeastTwo: false 

a, b, c = true, true, false 
allThree: false 
exactlyOne: false 
exactlyTwo: true 
atLeastOne: true 
atLeastTwo: true 

a, b, c = true, true, true 
allThree: true 
exactlyOne: false 
exactlyTwo: false 
atLeastOne: true 
atLeastTwo: true
